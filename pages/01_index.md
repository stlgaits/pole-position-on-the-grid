<!--
I was also a French & Spanish teacher and I had never written a single line of code yet. Happy days!
The work I'm going to present today was built in collaboration with my incredible colleague and mentor Loïc Frémont, who
unfortunately could not be here today but who's responsible for most of the ideas and implementations I'm going to show you today.
